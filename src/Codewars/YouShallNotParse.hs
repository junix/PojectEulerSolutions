Functions like read, ParseInt and to_i are irritating. Why? Because they fail! If the string isn't up to scratch, they throw a gigantic paddy. Wouldn't it be nice if we could check if a string could be parsed directly into an mathematical integer, both negative and positive?
In this kata, you must implement a function which checks if a string can be parsed directly into an integer, and returns a boolean based on it's result:

ghci> parses "-132"
True
ghci> parses "08942"
True
ghci> parses "62 4459"
False
ghci> parses "310.2"
False
ghci> parses "--9462"
False
ghci> parses ""
False
-}

parses :: String -> Bool
parses ('-':xs) = allDigits xs
parses xs = allDigits xs

allDigits [] = False
allDigits xs = all isDigit xs
